# Meta-Blocking with PyTorch on GPU

This repository contains code for performing **meta-blocking** operations on large datasets using **PyTorch** with GPU support. It reads data from CSV files and processes them with functions like **block purging**, **block filtering**, and **edge pruning**.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch with CUDA
- pandas
- numpy

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch pandas numpy
